# @dewicats/connect-button

## Description
The `@dewicats/connect-button` package provides a simple and efficient way to integrate Solana wallet connectivity into Next.js applications. It offers components and hooks that facilitate connecting to Solana wallets like Phantom or Solflare and using MagicLink for email-based user authentication.

## Installation
You can install the package using either npm or Yarn:

```bash
npm i @dewicats/connect-button
# or
yarn add @dewicats/connect-button
```

## Usage
This package is designed to be used with Next.js and requires dynamic imports to function properly.

### Connect Button Provider
Wrap your application with the `ConnectButtonProvider` to set up the necessary context for the connect button and hooks.

```javascript
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const ConnectButtonProvider = dynamic(
  async () => (await import("@dewicats/connect-button")).ConnectButtonProvider,
  { ssr: false }
);

const ProviderWrapper = ({ children }) => {
  const rpcHost = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REACT_APP_SOLANA_RPC_HOST ?? "";
  const magicKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAGIC_KEY;

  return (
    <ConnectButtonProvider magicKey={magicKey} solanaRpcHost={rpcHost}>
      {children}
    </ConnectButtonProvider>
  );
};
```

### Connect Button and useSolana Hook
- Use the `ConnectButton` component to render a button that allows users to connect their Solana wallet.
- The `useSolana` hook provides information about the wallet connection status.

```javascript
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const ConnectButton = dynamic(
  async () => (await import("@dewicats/connect-button")),
  { ssr: false }
);

const useSolana = dynamic(
  async () => (await import("@dewicats/connect-button")).useSolana,
  { ssr: false }
);

export default function Home() {
  const { publicAddress } = useSolana();

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Wallet Button</h1>
      <h2>publicAddress: {publicAddress}</h2>
      <ConnectButton compresedView />
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Features
- Easy integration with Next.js applications.
- Supports Solana wallets like Phantom and Solflare.
- MagicLink integration for email-based authentication.
- Provides both UI components and hooks for flexibility.
